# 📌 Pointers in C++ — From Basics to Advanced

This repository is a personal learning project that explores the full range of **pointer concepts in C++**, starting from the basics and gradually progressing to advanced use-cases. It’s designed to help both beginners and intermediate programmers strengthen their understanding of memory management and pointer operations.

## 📂 Project Structure

| File Name                                   | Description |
|--------------------------------------------|-------------|
| `pointer1.cpp`                              | Simple pointer declaration and dereferencing. |
| `FindTheAddressOfAVariable.cpp`             | Prints the memory address of a variable using `&`. |
| `PointerInitializationWithAddressOfOperator.cpp` | Initializes a pointer using the address-of operator and accesses the value. |

More files will be added as advanced topics are covered.
